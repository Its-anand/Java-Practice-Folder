/***
 * In Java, a literal is a syntactic element that represents a fixed value in the source code. 
   They are used to initialize variables or constants and can be of various types such as:

- Integer literals: Represent whole numbers, e.g., int i = 100;
- Floating-point literals: Represent decimal numbers, e.g., double d = 10.5;
- Character literals: Represent single characters, e.g., char c = 'A';
- String literals: Represent strings of characters, e.g., String s = "Hello";
- Boolean literals: Represent true or false values, e.g., boolean b = true;
- Each literal type has a format defined by the Java language specification.
  For example, integer literals can be expressed in decimal, hexadecimal, octal, or binary form.

    || Literal means the value that is going to be assigned
